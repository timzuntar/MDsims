## MDsims

### Purpose

This repository is a space for the results of any forays of yours truly into the world of molecular dynamics tools. Currently, the test simulations are limited to GROMACS [[1]](#1) and based on the suite of tutorials of J. A. Lemkul [[2]](#2).

Unless otherwise indicated, PyMOL [[3]](#3) was used for the visualization of molecular structures; all other plots were created with Matplotlib [[4]](#4).

### Results

The results of simulations are included and presented in their respective subfolders' readme files.

- Simulation and stretching of lysozyme protein [Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/MDsims/tree/main/GMX_1_lysozyme#readme)

- Calculation of interaction energy between a lysozyme and 2-propylphenol [Link](https://github.com/timzuntar/MDsims/tree/main/GMX_5_ligand_complex#readme)
