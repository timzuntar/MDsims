## MDsims

### Purpose

This repository is a space for the results of any forays of yours truly into the world of molecular dynamics tools. Currently, the test simulations are limited to GROMACS [[1]](#1) and based on the suite of tutorials of J. A. Lemkul [[1]](#1).

Unless otherwise indicated, PyMOL [[3]](#3) was used for the visualization of molecular structures; all other plots were created with Matplotlib [[4]](#4).
